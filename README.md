## About YumBook (The Recipe Book)
This is a simple Django application for storing and viewing recipes. The app features a homepage displaying the latest recipes, pages for browsing recipes by rating or category, and detailed recipe pages with ingredients and preparation steps. Only admin users can add, edit, or delete recipes. Clicking on a recipe opens a detailed view, showing the recipe name, image, ingredients, and preparation steps. The app does not come pre-loaded with recipes; instead, it is designed for you to add your own recipes and manage them on your local server.


## Features

- **YumBook - Home Page:** Links to the homepage. The home page displays the 3 most recently added recipes and bellow the 3 top-rated recipes.
- **All Recipes Page:** Displays all recipes sorted by rating.
- **Categories DropDown Menu:** A dropdown menu with cuisine types (e.g., Italian, Russian, Asian, Vegan). Selecting a category shows only recipes of that type.
- **Django Admin Page** to manage (add/edit/delete) recipes. The app dynamically displays updated content. Once a recipe is added, edited, or deleted in the database, the change will automatically reflect in the app without the need to modify HTML manually.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed on your system.

### Set Up the Aplication
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder: <br>
```git clone https://github.com/milangrahovac/yum_book.git```
2. Set Up a virtual environment. 
- Create the virtual environment: <br>

```source venv/bin/activate```
3. Install dependencies: <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Set Up the Database: <br>
- To store application data, you need to create a SQLite database file ```db.sqlite3``` in the root folder as its database. <br>
```touch db.sqlite3```
- Run the following commands to create and set up the database schema: <br>
```python3 manage.py makemigrations``` <br>

Follow the prompts to set up the admin username and password.
5. Run the development server: <br>
```python manage.py runserver```

## About The Makefile
Below are the available targets along with their descriptions and usage.

### Available targets
- ```make help``` - Lists all available targets in the Makefile along with short descriptions for each one. Run this command to get an overview of what you can do with the Makefile.
- ```make run``` - Stops the server on port 8000 if it's running and then starts the Django development server on port 8000. Run this command to ensure that you are starting the server fresh without any prior instances running. 
- ```make stop``` - Stops the Django development server if itâ€™s currently running on port 8000. 
- ```make requirements``` - Installs the Python packages listed in requirements.txt. Run this command to ensure your environment has all the necessary dependencies installed. 
- ```make migrate``` - Applies database migrations to ensure the database schema is up-to-date with the Django models. Use this command whenever you have made changes to your models and need to update the database schema accordingly.
- make ```test``` - Run tests

Once you have cloned the repository, installed the virtual environment, set up the database, and created a superuser with all the steps from the "Getting Started" section, you can easily run and stop the application using the Makefile.

### Using Makefile
Once you have cloned the repository, installed the virtual environment, set up the database, and created a superuser with all the steps from the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section, you can easily run and stop the application using the Makefile. 
1. Activate the virtual environment: <br>
